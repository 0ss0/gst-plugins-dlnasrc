WHAT IT IS
----------

gstdlnasrc is a source which utilizes souphttpsrc to perform an HTTP GET to retrieve content from a DLNA (Digital Living Network Allicance) DMS (Digital Media Server).

This plugin is an URI handler.  When URI is initialized, it will issue an HTTP HEAD request to retrieve information about the content using various DLNA defined HTTP headers supplied in the HEAD request.
Based on the response from the DMS, this plugin may include the dtcpip element in order to perform DTCP/IP decryption.

This plugin is designed to be selected by playbin as the source by adjusting the rank to primary + 1.

HOW TO BUILD IT
---------------
Issue the following commands from the dlnasrc directory:
./autogen.sh

This will produce a Makefile, initiate the make via:
make

Install the plugin via:
sudo make install

This plugin will be built when entering the same commands from gst-plugins-cl (parent directory)
